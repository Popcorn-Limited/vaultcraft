      <p>
        Because some jurisdictions prohibit the limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, in such jurisdictions the limitation of liability only with respect to consequential or incidental damages may not apply to you, and the respective liability of Popcorn Lmiited and its agents, council members, distributors and other partners is limited to the greatest extent allowable under applicable law in those jurisdictions.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the event that a court or arbitration panel, as the case may be, should hold that the limitations of liabilities or remedies available as set forth in these Terms of Use, or any portions thereof, are unenforceable for any reason, or that any of your remedies under these Terms of Use fail, then you expressly agree that under no circumstances will the total, aggregate liability of Popcorn Limited and its agents, advisers, employees, distributors, or affiliates, to you or any party claiming by or through you for any cause whatsoever, exceed CHF 100, regardless of the form of action and whether in contract, statute, tort or otherwise.
